        " I was going through a really tough time and I was really struggling to find the help I needed until I found MindMeldd. They were so amazingly understanding, efficient and responsive, and made sure I got the help I needed as quickly as possible. Their discounted student rates were also incredibly helpful for me and it made it much easier for me to seek help. ",
        " MindMeldd helped me with student-pocket friendly therapy session when I was in a rough spot. The team replied immediately and assigned a session (with an amazing psychologist/therapist) at my convenience and by the earliest. Plus the team is sensitive, helpful and punctual and offer assistance and reply ASAP (which is amazing). ",
        " My experience with MindMeldd was wonderful. In a low point in my life and mindset, Ms. Vedika really was a source of self-reflection and understanding. MindMeldd also made the whole customer experience really smooth and stress free- important when dealing with peopleâ€™s mental health. Overall, I would recommend this service for anyone that wants an understanding and empathetic ear and guidance "
